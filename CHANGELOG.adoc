= Elixir Changelog

== 2024-08 - WSGI update

* Migrated Elixir from a CGI-based architecture to a WSGI-based architecture. This should improve performance.
* Python files were moved from `./http` to `./elixir`.
* Made autocomplete use a prefix search that's native for the database. This should massively improve autocomplete performance.

Changes to configuration of most HTTP servers will be required.
Some HTTP servers may not support WSGI natively and may require a separate WSGI server to proxy to
(for example, lighthttpd and nginx do not support WSGI, but you can proxy requests to uWSGI).
We also recommend using Python virtual environments to manage dependencies.
Check "Manual Installation" section of README for details.
